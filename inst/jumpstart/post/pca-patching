# This script uses the existing patching tools to set up live upgrade and
# patch a box before putting it on the public network.  It does so by adding
# a false /etc/hosts entry for patchserver.my.domain which uses the 
# jumpnet address instead of the public address.
#
# This script must be run after rootfiles, extpkgs, and disksuite setup
# scripts (if applicable), but before cfengine runs because it requires wget,
# copied files, and modifies the boot device, but cfengine will wipe out the
# /etc/hosts entry when it runs.  This script also requires that
# solaris-patching is listed in the rootfiles section of the hostconf.
